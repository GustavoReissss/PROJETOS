          looking to make a transition and have heard some peopie who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun: I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling --time of my life, Since
          completing the course, I've successfuly switched careers, working as a
          Software Engineer at a VR startup."

          "Before joining the bootcamp, rve never written a line of code.Ineeded
          some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
          step by step. was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs
          who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
          curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
          andInever had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
          particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in
          a way thet no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred
          to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
          certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
          receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
